  - Reverse 32-bit number is a function that allows you to reverse 32 bit number. There are no special requirements. Just use it with paremeter represented by a number.
  - Check_product is a fuction that checks Cartesian Product with given number. Main idea was to check what is the Product of the letters on phone keyboard (when number is given).
  - Maximum_string is a function which splits the word with given number. For instance, if string "Hello World" is given with max_width=7, it will return list with strings ["Hello","World"]. This happens because, "Hello" with a space had 6 letters and this is less than 7. On the other hand, if max_width=4 the list will be empty.
